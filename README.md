# Google-Data-Analytic-Capstone-Bellabeat
This project is part of the final/capstone project of the Google Data Analytics class.

This documentation is done as part of the final project in the curriculum given in the Google Data Analyst course program. This case study will focus on analyzing the Bellabeat product, where in this scenario I am a junior data analyst working for a high-tech company specializing in women's health. 6 steps of analysis will be performed: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. The six steps are carried out to get the desired data (clean data) and draw conclusions from the analysis performed.

# Background

A smart device, also known as a connected device, is an electronic gadget that can communicate with other devices or networks to share and exchange data (such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, near field communication, Wi-Fi, NearLink, Li-Fi, or 5G). These devices are often equipped with sensors, internet connectivity, and software that allow them to collect and analyze data and perform automated or semi-automated tasks where user participation is still required to run the device.

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur that focuses on women's health. Since its founding in 2013, they have created various smart devices dedicated to women and one of them is a smart device that provides health data to users based on patterns performed by users in daily activities. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

Seeing this, Sršen realized that an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would show more opportunities for growth. He therefore wanted to analyze the user data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices.

My Role: My role in this scenario is as a junior data analyst in the Bellabeat marketing analytics team.
